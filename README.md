# Angular Movie App Demo
This is a temporary project for a mini code challenge. It will be made private after 7 days from it's  release.

## Viewing the demo

Currently, the demo is being hosted via Heroku at https://blair-iq.herokuapp.com

## Running Locally

`npm install` will install all npm modules, followed by the post-install script that will install the necessary bower packages.
`npm start` or `node server.js` will start the server and automatically open the app in your default browser.
